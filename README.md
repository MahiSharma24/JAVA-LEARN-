Java 

Java is one of the most popular and versatile programming languages used for developing applications ranging from simple desktop programs to complex enterprise systems. This repository serves as a starting point for anyone looking to learn Java fundamentals.

How Java Works

Java is a high-level, object-oriented, platform-independent programming language. Its Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA) capability allows developers to write code that runs on multiple platforms.

Key Components:

Java Development Kit (JDK): Tools required for Java development.
Java Runtime Environment (JRE): Provides libraries and JVM for running Java programs.
Java Virtual Machine (JVM): Executes Java bytecode on a machine.

Example: HelloWorld.java
This is a basic Java program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
// HelloWorld.java

public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
