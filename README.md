Prerequisites
Before diving into this repository, ensure you have the following:

A computer with Java installed (JDK 8 or above)
A text editor or IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code)
Basic understanding of programming concepts (optional but helpful)
How Java Works
Java is a high-level, object-oriented, platform-independent programming language. Its Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA) capability allows developers to write code that runs on multiple platforms.

Key Components:
Java Development Kit (JDK): Tools required for Java development.
Java Runtime Environment (JRE): Provides libraries and JVM for running Java programs.
Java Virtual Machine (JVM): Executes Java bytecode on a machine.
Compilation Process
The Java compilation process involves transforming human-readable code into machine-readable bytecode. Here's how it works:

Write the Code: Create a .java file containing the source code.
Compile the Code: Use the javac compiler to compile the .java file into a .class file (bytecode).
bash
Copy code
javac Example.java  
Run the Code: Execute the bytecode using the JVM with the java command.
bash
Copy code

Basic Java Concepts
1. Variables and Data Types
Learn about Java's primitive data types (int, float, char, boolean, etc.) and how to declare variables.

2. Control Structures
Understand conditional statements (if, else, switch) and loops (for, while, do-while).

3. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Dive into OOP concepts such as:

Classes and Objects
Inheritance
Polymorphism
Abstraction
Encapsulation
4. Exception Handling
Learn how to handle runtime errors using try, catch, and finally.

5. Input and Output
Work with Java's Scanner class for input and System.out for output.
